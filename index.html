		<h1>JavaScript tooling</h1>
		<h3>NPM</h3>
		<p>
			NPM stands for node package manager and it is what allows us to create a
			project with toolong configurations such as linting, bundling, transpiling
			etc. We create an NPM project with the 'npm init' command this then runs
			us through a series of terminal command steps to configure the project,
			name it, license it etc. Once that has run a package.json file is created
			which hosts the names and versions of all the tooling packages ypou choose
			to install for the project.
		</p>
		<h3>Project Dependencies</h3>
		<p>
			Project dependencies are tools that your app needs to run correctly such
			as libraries or frameworks for JavaScript. These tools run in your code
			and need to be present in the final build project for your app to run and
			work correectly. To install these kinds of dependencies you run the
			command 'npm install --save' followed by the name of the package/tool you
			want to install.
		</p>
		<h3>Dev Dependencies</h3>
		<p>
			Dev dependencies are tools that enhance the development phase/experience
			on your project so things that make your life easier and also enhance the
			code and code quality for example eslint, babel. To install dev
			dependencies for your project you run the command 'npm install --save-dev'
			followed by the name of the package/tool you want to install.
		</p>
		<h3>eslint</h3>
		<p>
			eslint allows us to lint our code during development which ensures we keep
			to a particular code standard that we set in the config. We set up an
			eslint config by running the command 'eslint init' this will init a
			configuration and guide you through some terminal steps for the
			configuration such as what frameworks you are using, popular styleguides
			etc. After running through this setup an eslintrc file is generated which
			can be in some chosen formats (typically JSON is chosen). In this file we
			can edit speicifc linting ruls for the config to customise it to our
			needs.
		</p>
		<h3>webpack</h3>
		<p>
			Webpack is a bundling tool that enables us to combine/bundle multiple
			files into one. Although bundling is its main feature webpack also has
			many other features making it a more complete workflow tool that also
			allows us to run transpilation and compilation of files before bundling as
			well as development servers and much more. To use webpack we first intall
			it as a dev dependancy with the command 'npm install --save-dev webpack'.
			Once installed we then create a configuration file called
			webpack.config.js. This config file then hold all the options/features we
			want to use e.g. bundling, transpliation, dev servers. Behind the scenes
			node then uses/runs that config file to do all the tasks such as bundling.
		</p>
		<h3>3rd Party Packages with Webpack</h3>
		<p>
			When we add dev or prod dependencies to our project and need to use them
			in code for example a library, we can import the methods, variables etc.
			that we need from the module by just declaring the library name without a
			file path. Behind the scenes webpack will detect that no file path has
			been given and will instead look through the node_modules folder for any
			packages that match that name.
