		<h1>JavaScript tooling</h1>
		<h3>NPM</h3>
		<p>
			NPM stands for node package manager and it is what allows us to create a
			project with toolong configurations such as linting, bundling, transpiling
			etc. We create an NPM project with the 'npm init' command this then runs
			us through a series of terminal command steps to configure the project,
			name it, license it etc. Once that has run a package.json file is created
			which hosts the names and versions of all the tooling packages ypou choose
			to install for the project.
		</p>
		<h3>Project Dependencies</h3>
		<p>
			Project dependencies are tools that your app needs to run correctly such
			as libraries or frameworks for JavaScript. These tools run in your code
			and need to be present in the final build project for your app to run and
			work correectly. To install these kinds of dependencies you run the
			command 'npm install --save' followed by the name of the package/tool you
			want to install.
		</p>
		<h3>Dev Dependencies</h3>
		<p>
			Dev dependencies are tools that enhance the development phase/experience
			on your project so things that make your life easier and also enhance the
			code and code quality for example eslint, babel. To install dev
			dependencies for your project you run the command 'npm install --save-dev'
			followed by the name of the package/tool you want to install.
